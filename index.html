      <h2><span>Personal</span> Information</h2>
      <p>My name is Aaron Caridakis and I am 18 years old. I graduated high school from Werribee Secondary College and now I am completing further studies at RMIT as a first year,
         doing the Bachelor of Information Technology (BP162). I was born in Australia but my parents are Indonesian / Greek, however I can only speak English.
         In my spare time I enjoy listening to music and playing video games. But I have one hobby in particular which I hold close to me, baseball.
         My interest in baseball began around 12 years old after my dad showed me the sport, he used to play as a kid and encouraged me to try it out.
         I used to play for the <a href="http://www.newportrams.com"target="_blank">Newport Baseball Club</a> however stopped due to an injury. </p>

      <h2>Interest <span>In</span> IT</h2>
      <p>Growing up technology has always been around, especially due to my father working in the IT industry. At a young age he would let me play around on the computer and this caused my interest in IT to begin at an early age. Recently after looking at IT career paths, networking really caught my eye as I find the idea of connecting devices together and letting them communicate with each other really interesting. My father also had a huge impact on this career path as he also worked as a Network Administrator and showed me many of the things he would do for his job.</p>
      <p class="white">I’ve been using technology pretty much my whole life so it’s only natural that I gained an interest in IT.
        My interest began through playing video games as a kid, the first game I played was World of Warcraft.
        I remember creating a character on my parents account and I felt so immersed in the world as I thoroughly enjoyed questing.
        This was just the start of my love for games and ever since I felt like I had a natural affinity for IT.</p>
      <p>I chose to study at RMIT due to the university being recognised for its strength in technology.
        I have strong interests in Information & Technology and I felt that RMIT was the perfect university to build and further develop the skillset I need for my career path.
        Another huge factor was the city campus being located in the Melbourne CBD, this makes it convenient as it’s easy to travel to and there are lots of resources available nearby.</p>
      <p class="white">During my studies at RMIT I hope to gain a lot of experience and knowledge specifically about python/html and networking.
        By learning about these topics I want to have a set of skills which I am happy with and should be able to help me in the workforce.</p>

      <p>Sadly I am lacking in many of the required skills/experience however I have a strong plan on how I can obtain the skills, qualification and experience needed for this job. First I will start by gathering as many relevant industry certificates which will help me for this position, an example of a certificate which I will aim to get is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-administrator" target="_blank"> Azure Administrator Associate Certification</a>. There are many free courses which I can gather certificates from Microsoft and these will help build my skills and ensure that I have the experience / knowledge needed. Next I will need to be able to troubleshoot with some advanced tools, so far I don't have the skills to do so but I am planning on learning how to use Wireshark, Procmon and Fiddler at a strong level. Furthermore I plan to complete a course for <a href="https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/courses.cfm?ui=www_edu&a=one&id_subject=93070" target="_blank">VMWare</a> to develop my understanding on how to use the software.</p>

      <h5>Myers-Briggs Test</h5>
      <p>The personality character I got from the Myers-Briggs Test was an Adventurer, the test shows that I am introverted, observant, feeling, prospecting and turbulent. Looking at the traits of an adventurer I definitely see myself alike. Some of the strengths of an adventurer are that I am sensitive to others, passionate and curious. These personality traits align with me as even though I am fairly introverted I am still passionate and curious about many things also I find myself able to easily relate to others' emotions. However, the weaknesses that an adventurer have are that they are fiercely independent, easily stressed and have fluctuating self-esteem.</p>
      <p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Within a team scenario I may find myself having a harder time, the adventurer personality trait is claimed to prefer independence, personally I'd rather work alone than in a group setting as I don't like sharing my own ideas as even I doubt them sometimes.</p>
      <p>When forming a team I will try be more open minded as I know that everyone will be working towards the same goal and we are all there to work and help each other. Even though I prefer to work alone I will work as a team when needed.</p>

      <h5 style="color: #FCFC;">Learning Style Test </h5>
      <p style="color: #FFFFFF;">The learning style test indicates that I am a visual learner and I learn by reading or seeing pictures. I agree with this as it tends to be easier for me to understand and remember things by sight. As a visual learner it claims that I am usually neat and clean and that I often close my eyes to visualise or remember something. As a visual learner I will learn better if I write down key words, ideas or instructions, avoid distractions during study times, try to visualise things that I hear or things that are read to me and colour code things. Overall a visual learner looks to be one that needs to be organised and free from distractions to produce good results.</p>

      <p>In a team, I may find myself distracted a lot because of those around me, this will put me off and make me unable to focus on what I need to complete myself. However there is also the upside of the others help me visualise the material and easier understand it.</p>

      <p style="color: #FFFFFF;">When forming a team, I need to take into account the behaviours of the other members, if they are too loud or distracting I will find it hard to complete my work so they need to be able to work by themselves for some time but also have the ability to communicate important information to the group when needed. Additionally it would probably be best if the other group members are also visual learners like me, as we will be able to easily share and help each other understand the work by visualising it.</p>

      <h5>Big Five Personality Test</h5>
      <p>The big 5 personality test shows that my biggest trait is agreeableness, I have the tendency to put others' needs ahead of my own and I'd rather cooperate than compete with others. I have a great deal of empathy and find enjoyment out of serving and taking care of others. Another big trait I have from this test is neuroticism, I tend to experience negative emotions more than other people. My lowest trait was extraversion, I don't seek stimulation from the outside world, especially in the form of attention from others. Being low in extraversion indicates that I am an introvert.</p>

      <p style="color: #FFFFFF;">Within a team setting I will be able to interact and work well with others as I will help them to the best of my abilities. Due to agreeableness being my highest trait, I will find it easy to cooperate with my other group members as I won't dismiss any of their ideas but instead take it in and provide feedback.</p>

      <p>When creating a team, I should have no troubles as long as they are competent or willing to put in the work to get the job done. Not only will it be easy for me, but my group members would find it valuable to work with me as I am very open-minded and willing to cooperate with them the whole way through.</p>

      <h2>Project <span>Idea</span></h2>
      <h5 style="color:#FCFC;">Overview</h5>
      <p>For my project idea I am planning on creating a video game, I want the game to be multiplayer where there is some type of interaction between players. Within the game I want there to be minimal lag and delay so that the user experience is good. Regarding the type of game, I am aiming for either a strategic / cooperation type of game or one where the players will verse each other, this is still unclear and will need further decision making before coming to a final point.</p>
      <h5>Motivation</h5>
      <p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Firstly, creating a video game would help me build my portfolio/resume, as working in the game industry is a potential future I have for myself. By creating my own game, I will be able to develop new skills and have some experience which will benefit me in the future. Secondly, I myself find great enjoyment in playing video games and I am really passionate about them. So creating a video game of my own would be challenging but also enjoyable.</p>
      <h5 style="color:#FCFC;">Description</h5>
      <p>As this will be the first game I ever make, I know there will be many limitations regarding how far I can get within the development stages. However, I already have the plan of making it some type of multiplayer video game where two to four players can at least somewhat interact with each other. I am going to be making my video game a software which people run on their computers and not one that they play on an internet browser as I think this provides a much better experience for the user. The player will be able to control their character's movement and interaction with the world using a set of keybinds on a keyboard. The final goal of this game will be to survive till the end by cooperating with each other and defeating enemies that spawn at an increasing rate. I want to include a random drop rate system where players get drops based off a RNG system when they kill the enemies. As this will be a survival type of game I want the terrain / map to be different each time it is played, to do so I need to use procedural map generation to ensure that the game can be played more than once and that players won't get bored. The game will need to be able to generate random worlds with different seeds. I want the game to be survival / roguelike meaning the player progresses and gathers items to get stronger and finally complete the game, but if they die they restart on a new world with nothing from the previous game session. I'm also planning on having there be multiple difficulties so that those that want a challenge can have one. However there will be a drawback regarding my game, as I want it to be multiplayer, the players will need to do port forwarding to play with each other, but there may be an opportunity to make it easily playable once I do more research. Regarding the graphics of the video game I will most likely be creating the 3d models myself as I want it to be original.</p>
      <h5>Tools and Technologies</h5>
      <p style="color:#FFFFFF;">To create my game I will be using unity, as unity is a C++ based game engine I will need to learn how to code in C++. Additonally as I plan on designing the models in my game myself I can do that in unity itself which will be easier for me as I won't have to use another software and worry about whether I can use both of them in conjuction.</p>
      <h5 style="color:#FCFC;">Skills Required</h5>
      <p>The main skills that are required for me to complete this project would be knowledge in programming with C++, thankfully there are many useful resources online and tutorials which I can use and learn fro, which will assist me in my project. Furthermore, unity is considered fairly beginner friendly so that will be extremely helpful when creating my own game.</p>
      <h5>Outcome</h5>
      <p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Finally, for my project to be a success, it would need to be a playable game. If I am able to achieve all my goals and what I am aiming for the game should look like a multiplayer survival / roguelike game where players need to survive waves of enemies until they complete the final stage. There will be multiple RNG elements such as the procedural map generation and the random drop system in which enemies will give random loot to help aid the player in their mission as they aim to complete the game.</p>
